                            <h2>Hausos: The Proto-Indo-European Dawn Goddess</h2>
                            <p>We have no writing or records about Hausos, just as we have no writing or records of any part of Proto-Indo-European (PIE) language and culture. All we know about the religion the PIE people followed we learn by reconstructing,
                                working backwards from the many European religions that descend from PIE, as well as ancient Hindu texts, the Vedas.</p>
                            <p>By working backwards from the 5 deities in this post, and seeing what they have in common, we can get a rough idea of what the original goddess was like, and work out her name. We know she was associated with the rising of
                                the Sun. She probably rode in a chariot, pulled by horses. We know she was beautiful, and probably a symbol of love and lust, as well as fertility and rebirth. She was probably the child of the Sky Father, Dyēus Phter (who
                                will be the subject of my next post!).&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>Her name, *Hausos, is derived from *h₂ews-, meaning “east” and “dawn”, and the names of all these goddesses are derived from her name.<i class="Latinx mention" lang="ine-pro"></i></p>
                            <h2>Ēostre: The English Spring Goddess<img class="alignright" src="https://i0.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Ostara_by_Johannes_Gehrts.jpg/220px-Ostara_by_Johannes_Gehrts.jpg?w=697&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image result for Äostre"
                                    data-recalc-dims="1"></h2>
                            <p>We know very little of the Anglo-Saxon deity called Ēostre. She was mentioned only by the contemporary historian Bede, who said that during her month, Ēosturmōnaþ (the Old English word for April), the Anglo-Saxon pagans celebrated
                                with a feast in her honour. This holiday was appropriated by the Christians as Easter, the celebration of the resurrection of Christ. As a spring festival, it remained associated with fertility and birth. The modern symbols
                                of Easter: eggs, rabbits/hares, newly born animals, are probably relics of this ancient association with fertility. <br>In Old German, the name of April was Ôstarmânoth, suggesting that they once had a related god, called
                                *Ôstara. The Proto Germanic word for this goddess could have been *Austrǭ, while their word for east was *austrą, which is where the name of the country “Austria” ultimately originates.<br>There is no record of a related
                                goddess in the Norse religion.</p>
                            <p>She was probably a goddess of the spring, and the dawn, and her name is related to the word East, showing an association with the raising sun.</p>
                            <h2 class="firstHeading" lang="en">Aušrinė: The Baltic Goddess of the Morning Star</h2>
                            <p class="firstHeading" lang="en">Aušrinė was a Lithuanian goddess associated with the planet Venus in the morning sky. Latvian paganism had a related god called “Auseklis”. She appeared in the form of the morning star (Venus), a beautiful maid, or a horse.</p>

                            <p>Aurora was the Roman goddess of dawn. She was also associated with sexuality and fertility, and often appears in sexual poetry. Her name also meant dawn, and the East. In modern English, she gives her name to the aurora borealis
                                (northern lights) in the arctic, and aurora australis (southern lights) in the Antarctic. Her name is related to the Latin word for “south”: “auster”, which is where we get “Australia”.<br>This means 6 of the words in the
                                sentence “Austrians watch the Aurora Australis in eastern Australia at Easter”, have the same root (PIE *h₂ews-).</p>

                                said to have rose coloured fingers and arms, likely an associations with the fingers of light from the rising sun.</p>

                            Hi! I’m Ryan. I make comics, images, and posts about things I’ve interested in. One of my favourite challenges is taking a very complex topic, and trying to make it simple, accessible, and visually appealing. I make a lot of these images simply because
                            nobody else has yet. I hate it when I’m trying to learn about a topic, but I can’t find any nice simple images, graphics or maps that summarise the information, and so I make my own.
